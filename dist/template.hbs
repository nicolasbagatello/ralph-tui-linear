## Workflow
1. Study the epic/PRD context above to understand the bigger picture
2. Study `.ralph-tui/progress.md` for status, implementation progress, and learnings
3. Implement this single task following acceptance criteria
4. Run quality checks: typecheck, lint, tests
5. Commit with message: `feat: {{taskId}} - {{taskTitle}}`
6. Document learnings (see below)
7. Signal completion

## Before Completing
APPEND to `.ralph-tui/progress.md`:
```
## [Date] - {{taskId}}
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
---
```

If you discovered a **reusable pattern**, also add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.md.

## Stop Condition
**IMPORTANT**: If the work is already complete (implemented in a previous iteration or already exists), verify it meets the acceptance criteria and signal completion immediately.

When finished (or if already complete), signal completion with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
